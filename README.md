# My Journey to Becoming a 10x Engineer

## Introduction

Welcome to my 52-week journey of growth and skill enhancement in the world of full stack and machine learning engineering. This repository documents my path towards becoming a 10x engineer - someone who goes beyond just coding faster or knowing more languages, but truly amplifies their impact, enhances team productivity, and pushes the boundaries of what's possible in tech.

### What is a 10x Engineer?

A 10x engineer is not just about speed or knowledge breadth. It's about:
- Amplifying impact across projects and teams
- Enhancing overall team productivity
- Pushing the boundaries of technological possibilities
- Combining technical expertise with strong soft skills and an innovative mindset

### Project Structure

This repository is organized into weekly folders, each containing:
- A README with the week's focus, goals, and reflections
- Code samples and mini-projects
- Resources and learnings

### Key Focus Areas

1. **Technical Mastery**: Deepening expertise in full stack development and machine learning.
2. **Soft Skills**: Improving communication, leadership, and problem-solving abilities.
3. **Innovation Mindset**: Cultivating creativity and embracing emerging trends.

### How to Navigate This Repository

- Check the weekly folders (`week-01`, `week-02`, etc.) for detailed progress and learnings.
- The `projects` folder contains larger, multi-week projects.
- `resources` holds useful links and documents collected throughout the journey.
