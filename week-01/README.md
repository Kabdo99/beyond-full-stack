2. Gain familiarity with ES6+ features such as arrow functions, let/const, and template literals
3. Introduction to asynchronous programming with Promises and async/await

## Practice Project: Weather Web Application

Features:

- Fetch weather data from a public API
- Display current weather conditions for a given location
- Allow users to input a city name or zip code
- Show a 5-day forecast
- Implement error handling for API requests
- Use at least one ES6 feature
- Demonstrate asynchronous programming with Promises or async/await
